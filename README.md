# bolt-proxy (bp) - An init system for web applications

`bp` allows us to host multiple web services using different hostnames from one
IP address. Web applications generated using `bolt` can be deployed and managed
by `bp` as part of a continuous integration and deployment pipe-line. `bp`
utilizes Google Cloud Platform, Linux, shell scripts, and programs written in 
Go, to streamline the process of enterprise software development.
